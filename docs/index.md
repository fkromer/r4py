This project is inspired by [Rust for C++ Programmers](https://github.com/nrc/r4cppp) and several blog posts I've read about "Rust for Python Programmers".

It has the purpose of:

- Showcasing the main differences (from a concepts point of view) between the Python and the Rust programming language.
- Promote the adoption of Rust for the implementation of performance critical parts of Python packages.
